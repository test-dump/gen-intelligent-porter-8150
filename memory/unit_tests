Here's how to create a "Hello World" console application in C#:

Code:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Steps:

1. Create a new file and name it `Program.cs`.
2. Paste the code above into this file.
3. Save the file.
4. Open a command prompt (Terminal if you are on MacOS) and navigate to the directory containing your `Program.cs` file.
5. Compiling: For Windows, use the csc compiler which is included with .NET Framework. For MacOS, use the mcs compiler included with the Mono Framework.
6. Type `csc Program.cs` (Windows) or `mcs Program.cs` (MacOS) and press enter. This will create `Program.exe`.
7. To run the program, type `Program` (Windows) or `mono Program.exe` (MacOS) and press enter.
8. You will see "Hello, World!" printed in your console.
